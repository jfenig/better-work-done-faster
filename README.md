# better-work-done-faster
A repository to help people learn Python so they can get better work done faster

Python is a general purpose programming language.

The purpose of these materials is to help you learn Python and apply it to improve your life.

The materials are organized around a learning philosophy that suits me, but may not be right for you. The philosophy is:

- Speak to your intrinsic motivation by showing how Python can help you get better work done faster
- Get you set up in an environment where you can test things for yourself and get rapid feedback
- Dive into the fundamentals of the language only as necessary to achieve a specific goal
- Show how to extend these fundamentals into other potentially interesting applications

This philosophy stands in contrast to many tutorials about Python, which start with grounding the student in fundamental concepts and methodologies. While that is probably the best approach for learning a new language comprehensively, it requires a lot of time and patience, and many mid-career learners will lose interest before they ever see what the language can actually do to help them!

These materials reference Python 3.x. If you are trying to learn Python 2.x, I would recommend [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).

## What can I do with Python?

If your work involves performing tasks in spreadsheets, then Python can help you get better work done faster.
